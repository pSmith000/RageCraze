## The 8hr Game Jam
Theme: Two Control

This is a game where you play as two different geometric friends trying to get to the end of the path you are on. The only catch is, you control them at the same time with the same controls. The physics of them, since they are not spheres, creates a challenging and rage-inducing game that's fun for everyone!

## How To Play:

Use WASD to move

Get to the end without raging

## Known Bugs:

If one of the players cannot move in a direction, move back in the opposite direction to gain momentum
